"""Apply unified diffs or line-range edits to a single file.

``unified_diff`` locates hunks by context and removed content, tolerating
line-number drift. ``line_replace`` replaces a 1-based inclusive range with
an optional ``expected_str`` check for stale content.

Both modes build the full result before writing. Any failed hunk or range
leaves the file unchanged.
